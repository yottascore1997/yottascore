  COUNT(ba.id) as amount_count
FROM QuestionCategory c
LEFT JOIN BattleQuizAmount ba ON c.id = ba.categoryId
WHERE c.isActive = true
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```

### **Check Auto-Created Quizzes**
```sql
SELECT 
  title,
  entryAmount,
  categoryId,
  isActive,
  createdAt
FROM BattleQuiz
WHERE isActive = true
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
```

## üéØ **Performance Testing**

### **Load Testing (50K Users)**
```bash
# Test with multiple concurrent users
# Monitor:
- Database performance
- Socket server memory usage
- Queue processing speed
- Matchmaking response time
```

### **Scalability Testing**
```bash
# Test scenarios:
1. 100 users searching simultaneously
2. 50 different amount combinations
3. Multiple categories with different amounts
4. Rapid amount configuration changes
